I’m an AI researcher, educator, and community builder passionate about Natural Language Processing (NLP) for social good. 

I am currently affiliated with Department of Computer Engineering and Advanced Analytics Lab at King Mongkut’s University of Technology Thonburi (KMUTT), Thailand. My journey in AI began with a master’s thesis on Burmese text classification, supervised by the wonderful Dr. Khin Thandar Nwet. During my Ph.D. at Prince of Songkla University Thailand, I expanded my research into medical AI under the guidance of my amazing advisors, Asst. Prof. Dr. Jarunee Duangsuwan and Asst. Prof. Dr. Wiphada Wettayaprasit. I have also worked on humanitarian AI projects as a senior NLP consultant, contributing to initiatives that received grants from Microsoft AI for Good and the UNDP.

I received prestigious scholarships such as Google WomenTechmakers (2018), Thailand Education Hub for ASEAN Countries (2018), and Kaggle BIPOC Grant (2021). 
As an educator, I teach core computer science/engineering subjects such as Data Structures, Database System, Software Engineering, and Machine Learning guiding the next generation of AI and software engineers.
Beyond academia, I’m passionate about responsible AI and AI ethics in low-resource NLP. I actively contribute to the AI and ML community as an AI Google Developer Expert and a board member of Women in AI Myanmar.
