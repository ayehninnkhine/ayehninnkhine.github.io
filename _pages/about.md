I’m an AI researcher, educator, and community builder passionate about Natural Language Processing (NLP) for social good. 

Currently, I’m a lecturer at KMUTT (King Mongkut’s University of Technology Thonburi), Department of Computer Engineering.  My journey in AI started with a master’s thesis on Burmese text classification and later expanded into medical AI during my Ph.D. I’ve also worked on humanitarian AI projects as senior NLP consultant that won grants from Microsoft AI for Good and UNDP.

I received prestigious scholarships such as Google WomenTechmakers (2018), Thailand Education Hub for ASEAN Countries (2018), and Kaggle BIPOC Grant (2021). 
As an educator, I teach core computer science/engineering subjects such as Data Structures, Database System, Machine Learning and Computer Engineering courses guiding the next generation of AI and software engineers.
Beyond academia, I’m passionate about responsible AI and AI ethics in low-resource NLP. I actively contribute to the AI and ML community as an AI Google Developer Expert and a board member of Women in AI Myanmar.
